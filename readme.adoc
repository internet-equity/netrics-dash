= Netrics Local Dashboard

Local (LAN) dashboard server & browser extension for extended reporting, measurement and control of Netrics experimentation.

This repository provides the source code behind the Netrics local dashboard and browser extension.
Basic orchestration for the local dashboard is also provided, via Docker,
as well as for its required https://github.com/m-lab/ndt-server[ndt-server].

Docker images are stored in Docker Hub:
https://hub.docker.com/r/chicagocdac/netrics-dashboard[netrics-dashboard],
https://hub.docker.com/r/chicagocdac/ndt-server[ndt-server] and
https://hub.docker.com/r/chicagocdac/ndt-server-full[ndt-server-full].


== Installation

=== Docker Compose

An example link:./docker-compose.yml[docker-compose.yml] is provided to deploy
the Local Dashboard web server, NDT server and data-extraction service anywhere.

=== Scripted

To provision a Netrics device (without Docker Compose), a bootstrapping script
is maintained under link:./bin/netrics-docker-run[bin/netrics-docker-run].

This script is intended for execution from the Netrics device. To execute this
script from another network-connected device (_e.g._ your laptop), any tool such
as SSH should be sufficient.

[TIP]
====
The below covers installation of a specified version of the local dashboard.

Consult the repository https://github.com/chicago-cdac/netrics-dash/releases[releases]
and/or https://github.com/chicago-cdac/netrics-dash/tags[tags].

Or query the latest release (via `curl`):

```sh
curl -s --head https://github.com/chicago-cdac/netrics-dash/releases/latest | grep location:
```
====

==== Local installation

To execute the script on a Netrics device and provision it with the local
dashboard &ndash; version 0.2.0 &ndash; _without_ cloning this repository:

```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chicago-cdac/netrics-dash/0.2.0/bin/netrics-docker-run | bash
```

==== Remote installation

TIP: The Netrics device is _generally_ network-accessible at host name
`netrics.local` and this will be assumed below.

To execute the script from your laptop and provision your Netrics device with
the local dashboard &ndash; version 0.2.0 &ndash; _without_ cloning this
repository:

```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chicago-cdac/netrics-dash/0.2.0/bin/netrics-docker-run | ssh ubuntu@netrics.local
```

Or, from a repository clone:

```sh
<./bin/netrics-docker-run ssh ubuntu@netrics.local
```

The local dashboard is then accessible at http://netrics.local/.


== Development

=== Background

As the target artifact of development is the Docker image, the Docker CLI is the
development environment's core requirement.

All development and orchestration tasks are defined (akin to the `Makefile`)
by the `manage.py` Python module, which is executed by the `manage` command
(see https://github.com/dssg/argcmdr[argcmdr]).

Development environment requirements beyond the above are therefore slim-to-none.
Nonetheless, a Python virtual environment is recommended, (if relatively unnecessary):

* https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv[pyenv] (and its extensions) remain among the
most powerful development tools by which to ensure Python versioning and library
requirements are met.
* Alternatively, self-management will always do the trick, _e.g._:
+
[source,sh]
----
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
----

=== Set-up

The development and orchestration environment may be configured and verified
via the guided set-up script link:./develop[develop]:

[source,sh]
----
$ ./develop 
(install) begin 

(python-3.7.0) check passed ✓ 

(cli) install? 
1) yes, install { pip install -r requirement/develop.txt }
2) no, ignore
#? 
----

=== Develop → Build → Deploy

All development and orchestration tasks may be managed via the `manage` command.

Get started serving the local dashboard from the cloned repository's source:

[source,sh]
----
manage serve
----

Explore management tasks via the `--help` flag, _e.g._:

[source,sh]
----
manage --help
----

and:

[source,sh]
----
manage serve --help
----

Preview tasks' operations via `--dry-run` (or `-d`):

[source,sh]
----
manage --dry-run serve
----

And view these as they're executed via `--show` (or `-s`):

[source,sh]
----
manage --show serve
----
