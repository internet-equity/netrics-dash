          <h2>Bandwidth.</h2>

          <p>
          Bandwidth is the amount of data that
	    you can send or receive from the Internet, 
	    through your router,
	    in "Megabits per second" (Mbps).
	  This affects how many people in your household can
	    can simultaneously use applications like Netflix or Zoom.
        </p>
        <p>
	  Your current bandwidth of 
	    <span id=text_ookla_dl>25</span>/<span id=text_ookla_ul>3</span>&nbsp;Mbps
	    <span id=text_bw_interp>is similar to other </span> households in Chicago.
	  It <span id=text_bw_fcc>exceeds</span> the "official" threshold of broadband Internet,
	    of 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps uploads.
	    Your connection is <span id=text_bw_stability>stable</span> over time.

	    <p>
	    The Internet uses a variety of different methods or 
	      "protocols" for sending information.
	    One method, called TCP, is used for data in websites
	      and another, UDP, is more appropriate for resource-intensive applications like 
	      videos, where some information loss is accceptable
	      (a missed frame is does not destroy the experience).
	    Accordingly, there are a number of ways of testing bandwidth:
	      some for UDP and others for TCP.
	    There are multiple programs for measuring TCP bandwidth.
	    Your Network Measurement Device runs all of these, to assess their consistency.

          <h2>Wi-Fi bandwidth</h2>

          <p>
	    Your Wi-Fi bandwidth is how much your wireless
	      router can send to your computer, per second.
	    If your Wi-Fi bandwidth is less than that of your wired connection,
	      you won't be able to use the full bandwidth that
	      you pay for from your ISP.

	      Wi-Fi is often the weakest link in a network connection.
	      There are some simple steps you can take to improve performance:
	      <ul>
		<li>
		    Move your Wi-Fi away from big chunks of metal like dishwashers or radiators.
		    These can really block the signal!
		</li>
 		<li>
		    Similarly, just putting the router "high up"&nbsp;&mdash;
		      on a bookshelp or cabinet&nbsp;&mdash;
		      can put less stuff between you and your router,
		      since most things are on the floor!
		</li>
	        <li>Buy your own Wi-Fi access point.
		    Since ISPs charge around $15 a month for rentals ($180 a year),
		      a modem / router combo pays for itself within a year.
		    You can probably get much better performance while saving money.
		</li>

          <h2>Latency.</h2>

          <p>
	    Latency is the amount of time that it takes
	      to reach a service on the Internet, like Wikipedia or YouTube.
	    This is measured in milliseconds &mdash;
	      thousandths of a second.
          </p>
          <p>
	    Your network latency to Google is 
	      <span id=text_latency_interp>similar to other</span> households in Chicago.
          </p>

	  <p class=extras>
	    <span onclick="toggle(this, 'latency_more')" class=toggle_button id=latency_more_tog>+ Learn more</span> <br>
	  </p>
	  <div id=latency_more class=learn_more>
	    <p>
	      Just as there are multiple forms of bandwidth, 
	        there are also multiple forms of latency.
	      Of course, we could measure the time delay to any single server (Google, Amazon, or the University of Chicago),
	      	and the latencies depend both on the network that you connect to (your ISP)
		and where the destination service is hosted. 
	      For example, Wikipedia is hosted on the West Coast, while
	      	the Chicago Tribune and the University of Chicago's website 
		are hosted on "Content Distribution Networks" that replicate content across the country, 
		<em>close</em> to consumers.
	      That physical distance matters.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      At a deeper level however, there are other Internet services that actually <em>do</em> things&nbsp;&mdash;
	        not just bounce a "ping" back and forth.
	      For example, the system that retrieves the computer-readable address (like 172.217.4.206)
	      	from a web URL (like google.com) has a timing delay.
	      The system is called DNS, and we measure the DNS latency.
	      Your Network Measurement Device also measures latency <em>under load</em>.
	      This is just the call and response time, 
	      	when your network link is fully used.
	      In practice, this would be like trying to read the New York Times,
	      	while your spouse downloaded a large file.
	      Your connection <em>should</em> be able to handle this,
	      	but many connections perform very poorly in these circumstances,
		a condition called buffer bloat.

          <p>
	    Your Network Measurement Device can record how much data you transmit

	    These data are recorded only if you elect to turn this feature on.
          </p>

	    At right is the single minute in the last 24 hours
	      with the highest download bandwidth.
	    Comparing this number with the bandwidth you buy
	      can help you decide if you need all the bandwidth you buy&nbsp;&mdash;
	      or if more would help.

	    <p>
	      Even for "intensive" applications like streaming movies or video conferencing,
	      	most applications only use 1 or 2 Mbps of bandwidth;
		you can probably find video calls as "boxes"
		in your upstream consumption.
	      True HD video uses somewhat more, up to 5 Mbps.
	      However this is only in the downstream direction, 
	      	which is usually better-provisioned.
	      For normal browsing, demand on the connection is "peaky":
	      	you click on a site and there's a "peak" in demand 
		that subsides a fraction of a second later, when the site has finished loading.
	      But almost any connection suffices for this sort of simple browsing.
	      The very-highest levels of bandwidth use come from downloading multi-gigabyte files,
	      	but this is rare for most people.
	      Using the plot below, you can assess how often you really "saturate" your connection.
